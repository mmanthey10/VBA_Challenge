###Module Challenge Two: Stock Analysis

##Project Overview
The purpose of the project was to refactor VBA code from Module 2 and determine if the refactoring made a meaningful impact of the efficiency of the script.

##Results of the Project
The code was refactored by creating arrays to house calculations that were output from looping through the data.

While the refactored code runs properly and re-created the same outputs for data and formatting, there was not a significant improvement in script efficiency.

Before refactoring, the module script would complete consistently around .7 seconds for both years 2017 and 2018.

The refactored code consistently ran for both years in .8 seconds.

##Summary

#Advantages of Refactoring
In this specific case, the refactoring did not create any advantages, however the overall advantage of refactoring will allow for a couple of advantages. 

First, the refactored code can be more easily read and be more intuitive for the next user of the code.

Second, in many cases, refactoring code will allow the script to run more efficiently which saves time.

The third advantage, directly relating to this analysis, was gaining a better understanding of how the code works. It gives the opportunity for the writer to fully understand what each line of code is meant to do which helps for potenital improvements and better general understanding.


#Disadvantages of Refactoring
In this example, the disadvantage was time lost spent refactoring the code that did not produce any meaningful improvement in script run time.
